My name is Deepak, born and raised in Machilipatnam. I completed my BTech at SVIET Nandamuru in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. My overall academic average score is 75%.

Before explaining my project, I'd like to discuss college websites.

Every college has its respective "College website" that contains details related to the college. Students currently attending the college frequently visit these websites. Additionally, prospective students who are considering joining our college (SVIET) also utilize these websites. My project is particularly beneficial for prospective students because I provide information related to the college that aligns with their needs.

College websites generally contain a plethora of information. Some prospective students may find it challenging to locate the specific information they require. Prospective students typically seek information such as faculty experience, labs, placement statistics, college history, ranking, fees, and the distance from their homes.

My project will be incredibly valuable to prospective students. Therefore, I've titled it "Website for SVIET Prospects." Now, I'll explain each page in detail.

This is the landing page of my website. On this page, I've included my name, key highlights, hyperlinks to other pages, a Facebook link, college email, YouTube channel link, contact number, and information about the latest events held at our college. I've also embedded a video to showcase the entire college layout. Many prospects may not find detailed information about the college layout and SVIET's campus elsewhere, so I've included images of the main building, buses, and event photos.

Now, I'll discuss the home page, which provides a summary of the college, including its history, vision, mission, and special infrastructure. I've used HTML's image tag to display a picture of the college at the beginning of the page.

Next, I'll explain the admission process at SVIET. On this page, I've provided clear details about the admission procedure and seat allotment. I've also designed an admission form that prospects can fill out and download. The form includes HTML form validation, and I've used linear gradient concepts for background colors.

Moving on to the library page, it contains details about the SVIET library, such as the number of magazines, core subjects, and an image of the library.

The faculty details page provides information about the faculty at SVIET College. I've included four buttons for different departments (CSE, ECE, EE, Mech), and when prospective students click on a particular branch, the corresponding faculty details appear in a tabular format. I've used HTML tables and CSS concepts like background-color and borders to design these tables.

The page featuring management details displays information about the college administrators. The purpose of this page is to showcase their social status, vision, greatness, and achievements.

The events page includes videos of events held at SVIET. I've embedded YouTube videos using the iframe tag. To embed a YouTube video in an HTML document, you can visit the video on YouTube, right-click on the video, select the "Copy Embed Code" option, and paste it into your HTML document where you want it to appear.

Now, I'll explain the placements page. This page lists companies that frequently visit SVIET, displayed using the marquee tag at the beginning of the page. Additionally, I've provided photos of candidates who were placed/recruited in the year 2023. Many prospective students are curious about placements, and this page will provide them with confidence in SVIET.

The course details page features four buttons that allow prospects to view subjects for each semester. I've also included details about the number of students taken for each department and the number of laboratories in each department, presented in tabular format using HTML tables. Furthermore, I've provided download links for prospects to access the entire syllabus for the four years, designed using the flexbox concept.

The course page displays program highlights and features of the courses offered at SVIET. I've presented the available programs in tabular format using HTML's table tag, which is essential information for prospective students.

Next is the enquiry page, which includes four main components: Mandatory Disclosure, Enquiry Form, College Contact Details, and College Address.

To instill confidence in prospective students, I've provided a Mandatory Disclosure section containing NAAC and NBA accreditation certified documents.

The College Contact Details section includes hyperlinks to the college's official email, contact number, college Facebook channel link, Twitter, and Instagram accounts. Through these links, prospective students can explore various aspects of the college.

The most crucial part of the page is the enquiry form. If prospective students still have questions after reading the details, they can ask using this form. I've designed this form using HTML forms concepts, and it includes four fields (Name, Email, Contact No, Query), all of which are mandatory.

Finally, I've included the college's address using Google Maps via the iframe tag in HTML to assist people who may have difficulty finding the location.

This concludes the current information about the college. Some additional elements and changes will be implemented in the coming days.
